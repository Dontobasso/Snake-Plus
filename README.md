# Snake-Plus

The classic snake game, but with more features (will be added soon). Made with python in VS Code.

Use arrow keys to navigate the snake. Your goal is to eat the red apples that randomly appear on the screen. 
Doing this will increase your score, but also increase the length and speed of the snake. 
This makes the game increasingly harder as you play. 
You lose the game when the snake crashes into a wall or itself. 
The higher your score when you lose, the better.

I hope you enjoy my game!
